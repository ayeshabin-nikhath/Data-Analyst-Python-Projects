## Project Overview

This Data Cleaning  project assists in cleaning the raw data available on the ESPN website regarding the players's history, their performance over the years. By cleaning the raw dataset, we get a clean and ready to use dataset for the further steps in the data analysis.

### Data Sources
From ESPN Website: PRIMARY DATA SOURCE : https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910
Which I drew into a CSV File: 'CricketWorld.csv'. That has the information of all the players from different countries.
In addition, I created some duplicated values to make the data more interesting.
